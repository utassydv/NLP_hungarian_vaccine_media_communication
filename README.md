This project is created for the [Unstructured Text Analysis course](https://courses.ceu.edu/courses/2020-2021/data-science-3-unstructured-text-analysis) at the Central European University.  Special thanks to [Eduardo Ari√±o de la Rubia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/earino/) who is the professor of this course as I learned a lot from him. This course is based on the wonderful book: [Text-Mining-R-Tidy-Approach](https://www.amazon.com/Text-Mining-R-Tidy-Approach/dp/1491981652/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1518881639&sr=8-1&keywords=tidytext).

## Technical introduction

The whole analysis is implemented in R and can be observed in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/utassydv/hungarian_vaccine_media_communication). The coding part can be separated into two main parts: 

- Web scraping parts
- Unstructured text analysis part

Throughout the whole process, I tried to follow the main principles of clean code, therefore one with R knowledge should follow it easily. There are plenty of further development possibilities in this project, therefore anyone who is interested, feel free to contact me [David Utassy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-utassy/) for any contribution. I will not show the whole code in this document, but I will highlight the most important snippets.
